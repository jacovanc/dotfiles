# Scripts
Run the scripts in this order:
1. setup_initial_user.sh
2. Sign in to the newly created user, as the next script will generate an ssh key for it
3. setup_ssh.sh
4. Add this new ssh key to any required services (e.g. git or any servers you want to connect to)

Top level script that will run them all in the correct order will be created later.
